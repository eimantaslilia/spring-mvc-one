# spring-mvc-one

This is a simple Spring MVC project that we host using Tomcat where we create:  
  
**Student Form** - students can enter first and last name, country, favourite programming language, operating systems that they enjoy using.
Countries are a drop-down list read from a .properties file, languages are set as radio buttons, operating systems are set as check boxes.

**Customer Form** - customers can enter first and last name, free passes, postal code and course code.
Last name field is required, free passes have to be between 1-10, postal code has to have only 5 letters/digits, course code has to start with TOPS.

While making this project I learned more about:

* What Spring MVC is  
* How to configure web projects  
* Request Mapping, Request Param  
* Reading Form data, displaying pages  
* Controller, View and Model  
* Reading CSS, JS and images  
* Spring MVC Form Tags  
* Spring MVC Validation
